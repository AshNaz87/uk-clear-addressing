# Changelog

## [0.1.2] 2014-12-05
- formattedAddress() now returns a premise attribute. This is a computed attribute to isolate the premise name taking into account all available information.

## [0.1.1] 2014-12-05
- Added fallback for 4 line addresses (very rare edge case): When an address spills over 3 lines, the remaining lines (lines 4 or more) are appended to line 3 and separated by commas
- Added fallback for address with only a sub_building_name (very rare edge case): See `weirdRule` in index.js
- Performance Improvement: Result of formattedAddress is cached
- Performance Improvement: Removal of string dependency
